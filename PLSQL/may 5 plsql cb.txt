Oracle has 2 engines
1)SQL engine   - If there is select,delete and insert it runs on sql engine 
Basic data retrieval and manipulation tasks will be done in sql engine

2)PLSQL engine - If it cannot runs on sql it runs on plsql.
It is used for implementing business logic, data validation and  complex data processing

-----------------------------------------------------------------
PLSQL
If we need to run consecutive sql queries we need PLSQL.
Procedural Language extensions to the SQL
Extends the limitation of SQL
---------------------------------------------------------------
View
Virtual table used to restrict the access of data to end users
Can aggregate datas from multiple table to single table
Partition large datas into small parts
Allow users to query data in a simplified and structured manner.

2 types of view
Simple and materialized view

Transactions table will be on simple view it needs load on very less time interval (OLTP)

Where OLAP use materialized view 

---------------------------------------------------------

Stored Procedures
blocks of code that are stored in the database and can be executed repeatedly

can accept input parameters, perform operations such as querying or modifying data in the database, and may or maynot return results.

Stored procedures can be called inside and outside plsql




Functions
