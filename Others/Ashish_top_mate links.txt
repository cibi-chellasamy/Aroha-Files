For Optimization following things are required:

    Variable - It is unknown and we have to find optimal value for this
    Parameter - It is known and given values
    Constraint - It is known and given conditions
    Objective function - We have to maximize or minimize this function

Linear models always gets the global minimum solution and Non linear models may get stuck in the local minimum solution

Linearization techique such as BigM can be used to convert Non linear models into linear models
