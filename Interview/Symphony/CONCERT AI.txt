I ANSWERED HIM I CAN SOLVE IT IN CORELATED & DERIVED. AFTER THAT HE SAID OK SOLVE IT & TELL US 
MY QUERY :
SELECT I1.* , (SELECT ACCESSORY_NAME FROM INT2 I2 WHERE I1.PRODUCT_ID = I2.PRODUCT_ID AND I2.ACCESSORY_ID = 3 ) AS THIRD_ACCESSORY_NAME
FROM INT2 I1 ;
WE ARGUED A LOT IN THIS QNS.THE REASON IS HE'S KNOWS ONLY SQL SERVER & HE DIDNT TOLD ME THAT HE KNOWS SQL SERVER. 
AT THE END ONLY HE MENTIONED IN SQL SERVER IT WONT WORK THEN ONLY I COME TO KNOW THAT HE'S ASKING IT FROM SQL SERVER SO I EXPLAINED HIM IN THAT.
