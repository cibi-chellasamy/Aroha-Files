========================
typically the code seems to be fine !!

data = "100010010001110011"
how = int(input('enter the number of 0\'s to count ' ))
count=0
ctr=0
length = len(data)
length = length -1
while  True:
     print(data[ctr],end='')
     if data[ctr] == '0':
            count+=1
     if count == how  or ctr == length:
        break
     ctr = ctr + 1
print()
print("The count is",count,"So The loop is stop")

but there is a VITAL catch !!
===================
a =10
b = 22
a,b = b,a
HOW the numbers are swapped in Python....

=====
another way of executing the code to print the highest and the lowest...

num=0
maxi_num=0
mini_num=0
count=0
while True:
    number=int(input("enter number = "))
    if number == -1:
        break
    if count == 0:
       maxi_num,mini_num = number,number
      
    if number>maxi_num:
        maxi_num=number
        
    if number<mini_num:
        mini_num=number
        
    count=count+1    

    num=num+number
if count != 0:
  avg=num/ count
  print('higest number is ',maxi_num)
  print('lowest number is ',mini_num)
  print("total is ",num)
  print("avg is ",avg)
else:
  print ('brother you did not enter ANY number !! ')

          starting point of the Python code to execute

qs) find the position of the word in the sentence
answer) use index() of the str
how???
sentence = 'all that glitters is not Gold. Gold is a noble metal'
word = 'Gold'
p = sentence.index(word)
print(p)

====working code ======
sentence = input('enter some sentence ... ')
print('you entered ... ')
print(sentence)
word_replace = input('enter the word you wish to replace ')
new_word = input('with what WORD you wish to replace ? ')
how = int(input('how many occurance you wish to replace ? '))
result = sentence.replace(word_replace,new_word,how)
print('ORIGINAL ',sentence)
print()
print('NEW SENT ... ',result)

===commonly used str methods ====
s1 = "HarishKumar"
s2 = "3535633"
s3 = "RX7812BV991"
s4 =  "1256"
r1 = s1.isalpha()
r2 = s2.isdigit()
r3 = s3.isalnum()
r4 = s4.isdecimal()
print(r1,' all ALPHABETS ONLY ',s1)
print(r2,' all DIGITS  ONLY ',s2)
print(r3,' ALPHA-NUMERIC ONLY ',s3)
print(r4,' has decimal ?  ',s4)
s5 = "HX-3335^2383288*@7262363::PPWW"
r5 = s5.isascii()
print(r5,' has decimal ?  ',s5)

str to number .... int(s1)
str to decimal .... float(s2)

====working code =====
'''
input ANY five POSITIVE INT numbers (use str for inputting)
if it is not number IGNORE it
'''
count = 0
total = 0
int_count = 0
real_count = 0
while True:
  data = input('enter POSITIVE INT number ')
  if data.isdigit():
     total = total + int(data)
     print('number is ',data)
     int_count = int_count + 1 
     count = count + 1 
  if count == 5:
    break 
print ('total ',total)
