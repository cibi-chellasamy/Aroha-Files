------------------ LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM--------------------------------------

1.Linux is an open-source operating system and it is built upon the Linux kernel. It is like Windows, Mac, Android etc.
2.The Linux Kernel is like the brain of the operating system because it manages how the computer interacts with its hardware and resources.
3.The Linux Kernel is combined with a collection of software packages and utilities, which are together called Linux distributions ( Ubuntu,Debian,openSUSE etc).
  These distributions make the Linux Operating System ready for users to run their applications and perform tasks on their computers securely and effectively. 
4.Linux is a multi-programming, multi-user operating system, it means the same system can be used by different users with different access rights and simultaneously many applications can be run on it. 

Linux Architecture ::
----------------------
1.Kernel 
2.System Library : System libraries act as an interface between applications and the kernel, providing a standardized and efficient way for applications to interact with the underlying system.
3.Shell :  The shell serves as a bridge between the user and the kernel, forwarding the user’s requests to the kernel for processing.
4.Hardware Layer : RAM (Random Access Memory), HDD (Hard Disk Drive), CPU (Central Processing Unit), and input/output devices.It is responsible for interacting with the Linux Operating System and providing the necessary resources for the system and applications to function properly.  
5.System Utility : to perform tasks such as installing software, configuring network settings, monitoring system performance, managing users and permissions, and much more. 


Advantages of Linux ::
------------------------
1.open-source operating system
2.more secure than other OS
3.it maintains the privacy of the user
4.easy to install 


Difference b/w Linux and Windows ::
------------------------------
           Linux                                                                                       Windows
1.Linux is a open source operating system.                                       1.While windows are the not the open source operating system.

2.Linux is free of cost.                                                         2.While it is costly.

3.There is forward slash is used for Separating the directories.                 3.While there is back slash is used for Separating the directories.

4.Root user is the super user and has all administrative privileges.             4.Administrator user has all administrative privileges of computers.

FILE STRUCTURE ::

In Linux, the filesystem is organized in a hierarchical structure, resembling an inverted tree. 
This structure starts from the root directory, denoted by a forward slash (/), which is the base of the filesystem.
All other files and directories are contained within this root directory.       

Root Directory (/): The top-most level of the filesystem. Every file and directory starts from here.
Subdirectories: Directly under the root directory, there are several important subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose. For example:

    /bin - Contains essential user command binaries (programs).
    /etc - Contains system configuration files.
    /home - Contains personal directories for users.
    /usr - Contains user utilities and applications.
    /var - Contains variable data like logs and databases.

User Directories: Within /home, each user has a directory (e.g., /home/username) containing their personal files, documents, and settings.
Pathnames: Files and directories are accessed by their pathnames. An absolute pathname starts from the root (/) and describes the exact location of a file or directory. A relative pathname starts from the current directory.       

==============================================================================================================================================================================================
Linux commands ::
--------------------------------
1. ls :: lists directory contents of files and directories.
         ls -l : displays detailed information about files and directories.
         ls -a : includes hidden file and directories.
         ls -t : displaying the most recently modified ones first.
         ls -r : reverse order of the string.
         ls -S : sort files and directories by thier size.
         ls -R : List files and directories recursively, including subdirectories.
         
                     -rw-r--r-- 1 Dell 197121        316 Dec 21 22:09  fibonacci.txt
          1st field    : File type --- - ( normal file ), d ( directory file ), s ( socket file ), l (link file)
                         File permissions --- read,write,execute for user(root),group,others
                         Number of links 
                         Owner -- owner of the file
                         Group -- group of he file
                         Size -- size in bytes
                         Last modified date and time 
                         File name

Question :: 1. Order Files Based on Last Modified Time (In Reverse Order)

=========================================================================================================================================

2. cd :: change directory.
         cd / : changes to the root directory
         pwd : present working directory/ current directory
         cd dir1/dir2/dir3 : to move into sub-directories
         cd ~ or cd : changes to home directory from any directory
         cd .. : which is used to move to the parent directory of current directory, or the directory one level up from the current directory. “..” represents parent directory.

=========================================================================================================================================

3.pwd :: present working directory.
         
========================================================================================================================================
4.mkdir :: create directory. ( mkdir dir_name )

=======================================================================================================================================
5.touch :: create a file without any content.
           syntax : touch file_name

=======================================================================================================================================
6.cat :: create a file with content.
         syntax : cat > file_name
                  type the content for the file if not press ctrl+D
                  cat file_name
         cat -n file_name : to view contents of the file with line numbers
         cat file1 >> file2 : appending the content of file1 to the end of file2
         tac file_name : displaying the content in reverse order

======================================================================================================================================
